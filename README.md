# apps

my current truenas scale app across multiple nodes -> [my apps](./my-apps.md).

checkout the n8n [workflow](./truenas_app_list_generator_template.json) and upload it to your local n8n instance.

# prerequisites

- add this node [splitinbatches-advanced](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-splitinbatches-advanced) to your n8n instance to use the workflow

- In scale go to the top right person settings -> api keys or http://truenas.local:81/ui/apikeys and create an api key to authenicate the scale api.
- Create a repo and add a empty markdown file (and call it whatever you like.) or use the README.md, the choice is yours.

# setup the get-config-data node

just edit the "get-config-data" node and replace the following fields in ALL CAPS.

the "scale_servers" is an json object array that will support multiple servers.

the "filter_list" is a string array of chart names that will be excluded from the list if you dont want them to be listed in the app-list.md
for example: ["n8n", "app1", "app2"]

manually run the workflow or activate it to run every 6hrs (change the cron node to whatever you want.)
